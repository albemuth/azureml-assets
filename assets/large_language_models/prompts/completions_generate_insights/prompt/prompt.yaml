  Over the last five years, our company has tracked the sales performance of our five products: Product A, Product B, Product C, Product D, and Product E. Our analysis shows that Product A has consistently been the top-selling product, with an average of 10,000 units sold per year, generating $2 million in annual revenue and a profit margin of 15%. However, the profit margin for Product A has decreased over the past two years, indicating a need for re-evaluation of our pricing strategy. Product B and Product C have also shown steady sales and profitability, with an average of 7,500 units sold per year, generating $1.5 million in annual revenue, and a consistent profit margin of 20%. Product D has seen a slight decline in sales over the past two years, with an average of 5,000 units sold per year, generating $1 million in annual revenue, and a profit margin of 10%. Our analysis suggests that we may need to adjust our marketing or product development strategies to improve its performance. Product E has shown the lowest sales and profitability among the five products, with an average of 2,000 units sold per year, generating $400,000 in annual revenue, and a profit margin of 5%. Further investigation and potential changes to our product offering or marketing approach are necessary to improve the performance of Product E. Overall, our sales performance analysis suggests that we should focus on maintaining the profitability of our top-selling products while exploring ways to improve the performance of our less successful products.

Compare the performance of each product and determine which one is the most profitable.
